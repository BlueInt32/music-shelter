# Shelter

## The concept

The initial idea of Shelter is to store ideas for musical inspiration.

I would go into the Shelter, and there, I would have the opportunity to pick random `stuff`, view it (text, image, video (link or file)) and apply some `tags` to it.\
For example, if I found a really cool video speaking about drums and it contains also some drum sound design, I can apply both the _drums_ and _sound design_ tag. Then I can find this `stuff` through both of those `tags`.

## Tags, categories and hierarchy

I think it is enough that `tags` cannot have parent tags or such things.\
Would it be relevant for example to have a _music_ parent `tag` for _drum_ and _sound design_ ? Later this would allow me to create e.g. the _funny_ parent `tag` for all funny `stuff` that are not related to music.\
But I think this could be done without the whole recursive mess with some autotagging mecanism. e.g. the user stating that the `tag` _drum_ is automatically associated with the `tag` _music_. I think this is enough for my need. We will see.

## Naming

It is hard to give a name to the items of the app (i.e. the things you add and manage in the Shelter). All those words have a kind of nice touch but do not fit exactly :

- item/thing/thingy: too vague
- gem: too precious
- loot: too video-game
- junk: too secondhand
- stuff: no plural, a bit too familiar
- pack: too down-to-earth
- post: too bloggy

### Naming idea

Gem and thingy have a nice correlation : you just found something and you do not want to lose time so you put it in the shelter for later review (or it is not sure that it is a gem yet).\
Afterwards, you go to the Shelter and find out it was actually a gem (or you discard it). Basically _thingy_ would be a tag applied by default when you do not want to take time to properly qualify a new item in the app. Gem is the name when it has been properly qualified.
This would be purely wording though, because technically everything would be a `gem`, except that you auto-tag _thingy_ on every gem that have no `tag`.

### Featured tags ?
