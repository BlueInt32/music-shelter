# Shelter

## The concept

The initial idea of Shelter is to store ideas for musical inspiration.

I would go into the Shelter, and there, I would have the opportunity to pick random stuff, view it (text, image, video (link or file)) and apply some `tags` to it.\
For example, if I found a really cool video speaking about drums and it contains also some drum sound design, I can apply both the _drums_ and _sound design_ tag. Then I can find this stuff through both of those `tags`.

## Tags, categories and hierarchy

I think it is enough that `tags` cannot have parent tags or such things.\
Would it be relevant for example to have a _music_ parent `tag` for _drum_ and _sound design_ ? Later this would allow me to create e.g. the _funny_ parent `tag` for all funny `stuff` that are not related to music.\
But I think this could be done without the whole recursive mess with some autotagging mecanism. e.g. the user stating that the `tag` _drum_ is automatically associated with the `tag` _music_. I think this is enough for my need. We will see.

## Elements

It is hard to give a name to the items of the app (i.e. the things you add and manage in the Shelter). They can be so many different things, so the name must be generic. I went for "element". 

### Featured tags ?
